with two completely separate sensors in a single housing is acceptable.


**T.4.2.3** The APPS sensors must meet the three:

� Have different transfer functions which have different gradients and/or offsets to the
other(s)

� Have a pull-up or pull-down resistor in circuit to bring an open circuit input to 0% pedal

� At any pedal position above 10%, the pedal travel output of a single sensor must differ by
minimum 10% from any other sensor

Opposite slope sensors that do not meet this requirement will not be permitted

**T.4.2.4** Implausibility is defined as a deviation of more than 10% Pedal Travel between the sensors or
other failure as defined in this Section [[#T.4.2 Accelerator Pedal Position Sensor - APPS|T.4.2]]. Use of values larger than 10% Pedal Travel
require justification in the ETC Systems Form and may not be approved

**T.4.2.5** If an Implausibility occurs between the values of the APPSs and persists for more than 100
msec, the power to the (IC) Electronic Throttle / (EV) Motor(s) must be immediately stopped
completely.

(EV only) It is not necessary to Open the Shutdown Circuit, the motor controller(s) stopping
the power to the Motor(s) is sufficient.

**T.4.2.6** If three sensors are used, then if one APPS failure, any two sensors that agree within 10%
Pedal Travel may be used to define the (IC) throttle position / (EV) torque target and the 3rd
APPS may be ignored.

**T.4.2.7** Each APPS must be able to be checked during Technical Inspection by having one of the two:

� A separate detachable connector that enables a check of functions by unplugging it

� An inline switchable breakout box available that may disconnect each APPS signal

**T.4.2.8** The APPS signals must be sent directly to a controller using an analogue signal or via a digital

**T.4.2.9** Any failure of the APPS or APPS wiring must be detectable by the controller and must be
treated like an Implausibility, see [[#T.4.2 Accelerator Pedal Position Sensor - APPS|T.4.2.4]] above

**T.4.2.10** When an analogue signal is used, the APPS will be considered to have failed when they
achieve an open circuit or short circuit condition which generates a signal outside of the
normal operating range, for example <0.5 V or >4.5 V

The circuitry used to evaluate the sensor must use pull down or pull up resistors to make sure
that open circuit signals result in a failure being detected

**T.4.2.11** When any kind of digital data transmission is used to transmit the APPS signal:

a. (IC Only) The ETC Systems Form must contain a detailed description of all the potential
failure modes that can occur, the strategy that is used to detect these failures and the
tests that have been conducted to prove that the detection strategy works

b. The failures to be considered must include but are not limited to the failure of the APPS,
APPS signals being out of range, corruption of the message and loss of messages and the
associated time outs

� A separate detachable connector(s) for any BSE signal(s) to the main ECU without
**T.4.3.5** affecting any other connections

� An inline switchable breakout box available that may disconnect each BSE signal(s) to the
main ECU without affecting any other connections

The BSE or switch signals must be sent directly to a controller using an analogue signal or via a
digital data transmission bus such as CAN or FlexRay

Any failure of the BSE or BSE wiring that persists more than 100 msec must be detectable by
the controller and treated like an implausibility and power to the (IC) electronic throttle / (EV)
Motor(s) must be immediately stopped completely.

(EV only) It is not necessary to completely deactivate the Tractive System, the motor
controller(s) stopping power to the motor(s) is sufficient.

When an analogue signal is used, the BSE sensors will be considered to have failed when they
achieve an open circuit or short circuit condition which generates a signal outside of the
normal operating range, for example <0.5 V or >4.5 V.

The circuitry used to evaluate the sensor must use pull down or pull up resistors to make sure
that open circuit signals result in a failure being detected.

When any kind of digital data transmission is used to transmit the BSE signal:

a. The ETC Systems Form must contain a detailed description of all the potential failure
modes that can occur, the strategy that is used to detect these failures and the tests that
have been conducted to prove that the detection strategy works.

b. The failures modes must include but are not limited to the failure of the sensor, sensor
signals being out of range, corruption of the message and loss of messages and the
associated time outs.

c. In all cases a sensor failure must immediately shutdown power to the motor(s)

### IC.4.4 Throttle Position Sensor - TPS

**IC.4.4.1** The TPS must measure the position of the throttle or the throttle actuator.

Throttle position is defined as percent of travel from fully closed to wide open where 0% is
fully closed and 100% is fully open.

**IC.4.4.2** Two or more separate sensors must be used as TPSs. The TPSs may share the same supply and
reference lines only if effects of supply and/or reference line voltage offsets can be detected.

**IC.4.4.3** Implausibility is defined as a deviation of more than 10% throttle position between the
sensors or other failure as defined in Section IC.4. Use of values larger than 10% may be
considered on a case by case basis and require justification in the ETC Systems Form

**IC.4.4.4** If an Implausibility occurs between the values of the two TPSs and persists for more than 100
msec, the power to the electronic throttle must be immediately shut down.

**IC.4.4.5** If three sensors are used, then if one TPS failure, any two TPSs that agree within 10% throttle
position may be used to define the throttle position target and the 3rd TPS may be ignored

**IC.4.4.6** Each TPS must be able to be checked during Technical Inspection by having one of:

a. A separate detachable connector(s) for any TPS signal(s) to the main ECU without
affecting any other connections

b. An inline switchable breakout box available that may disconnect each TPS signal(s) to the
main ECU without affecting any other connections

**IC.4.4.7** The TPS signals must be sent directly to the throttle controller using an analogue signal or via
a digital data transmission bus such as CAN or FlexRay. Any failure of the TPSs or TPS wiring
must be detectable by the controller and must be treated like Implausibility.

**IC.4.4.8** When an analogue signal is used, the TPSs will be considered to have failed when they achieve
an open circuit or short circuit condition which generates a signal outside of the normal
operating range, for example <0.5 V or >4.5 V.

The circuitry used to evaluate the sensor must use pull down or pull up resistors to make sure
that open circuit signals result in a failure being detected.

**IC.4.4.9** When any kind of digital data transmission is used to transmit the TPS signal,

a. The ETC Systems Form must contain a detailed description of all the potential failure
modes that can occur, the strategy that is used to detect these failures and the tests that
have been conducted to prove that the detection strategy works.

b. The failures to be considered must include but are not limited to the failure of the TPS,
TPS signals being out of range, corruption of the message and loss of messages and the
associated time outs.

a. The power to the electronic throttle must be shut down if the mechanical brakes are
operated and the TPS signals that the throttle is open by more than a permitted amount
for more than one second.

b. An interval of one second is permitted for the throttle to close (return to idle). Failure to
achieve this in the required interval must result in immediate shut down of fuel flow and
the ignition system.

c. The permitted relationship between BSE and TPS may be defined by the team using a
table. This functionality must be demonstrated at Technical Inspection.

**IC.4.7.2** Throttle Position vs Target

a. The power to the electronic throttle must be immediately shut down, if throttle position
differs by more than 10% from the expected target TPS position for more than one
second.

b. An interval of one second is permitted for the difference to reduce to less than 10%,
failure to achieve this in the required interval must result in immediate shut down of fuel
flow and the ignition system.

### D.12.13 Endurance Scoring
**D.12.13.1** Scoring Term Definitions:

� Endurance Run Time - Total Time for the two Drivers, minus the Driver Change lap,
minus any Mechanical Black Flag Time, plus any Penalty time [[#D.14.2 Post Endurance Penalties|D.14.2]]

� Corrected Time = Endurance Run Time + ( DOO * 2 ) + ( OC * 20 )

� Tyour - the Corrected Time for the team

� Tmin - the lowest Corrected Time recorded for any team


� Tmax - 145% of Tmin

**D.12.13.2** The vehicle must complete the Endurance Event to receive a score based on their Corrected
Time

a. If Tyour < Tmax, the team score is calculated as:

Endurance Time Score =    250 x                  ( Tmax / Tyour ) -1
( Tmax / Tmin ) -1

b. If Tyour > Tmax, Endurance Time Score = 0

**D.12.13.3** The vehicle receives points based on the laps and/or parts of Endurance completed.

The Endurance Laps Score is worth up to 25 points

**D.12.13.4** The Endurance Score is calculated as:

Endurance Score = Endurance Time Score + Endurance Laps Score

## D.13 EFFICIENCY EVENT

The Efficiency event evaluates the fuel/energy used to complete the Endurance event

### D.13.1 Efficiency General Information
**D.13.1.1** The Efficiency is based on a metric of the amount of fuel consumed or energy used and the lap

time on the endurance course, averaged over the length of the event.
**D.13.1.2** The Efficiency score is based only on the distance the vehicle runs on the course during the

Endurance event, and the total fuel/energy used. No adjustment to distance or fuel/energy
will be made.

### D.13.2 Efficiency Procedure
**D.13.2.1** For IC vehicles:

a. The fuel tank must be filled to the fuel level line ([[#IC.5.4    Fuel Filler Neck & Sight Tube|IC.5.4.5]])
b. During fuelling, once filled to the scribe line, no shaking or tilting of the tank, fuel system,

or the entire vehicle is permitted
**D.13.2.2** (EV only) The vehicle may be fully charged
**D.13.2.3** The vehicle will then compete in the Endurance event, refer to [[#D.12.5 Endurance Event Procedure|D.12.5]]
**D.13.2.4** Vehicles must power down after leaving the course and be pushed to the fueling station or

data download area
**D.13.2.5** For Internal Combustion vehicles (IC):

a. The Fuel Tank must be filled to the Fuel Level Line ([[#IC.5.4    Fuel Filler Neck & Sight Tube|IC.5.4.5]]) to measure fuel used.
[[#IC.5.5 Fuel Tank Filling|IC.5.5.1]]

b. If the fuel level changes after refuelling:

� Additional fuel will be added to return the fuel tank level to the fuel level line.

� Twice this amount will be added to the previously measured fuel consumption
c. If damage or a potential environmental hazard (example - Fuel Tank leakage) exists, the

Fuel Tank will not be refilled [[#D.13.3 Efficiency Eligibility|D.13.3.4]]


**D.13.2.6** For Electric Vehicles (EV):

a. Energy Meter data must be downloaded to measure energy used and check for
Violations [[#EV.3.3 Power and Voltage|EV.3.3]]

b. Penalties will be applied per [[#EV.3.5 Penalties|EV.3.5]] and/or [[#D.13.3 Efficiency Eligibility|D.13.3.4]]

### D.13.3 Efficiency Eligibility
**D.13.3.1** Maximum Time

Vehicles whose average Endurance laptime exceeds 1.45 times the average Endurance
laptime of the fastest team that completes the Endurance event get zero points
**D.13.3.2** Maximum Fuel/Energy Used
Vehicles whose corrected average (IC) fuel consumption / (EV) energy equivalent per lap
exceeds the values in [[#D.13.4 Efficiency Scoring|D.13.4.5]] get zero points
**D.13.3.3** Partial Completion of Endurance
a. Vehicles which cross the start line after Driver Change are eligible for Efficiency points

b. Other vehicles get zero points
**D.13.3.4** Cannot Measure Fuel/Energy Used

### D.13.4 Efficiency Scoring

**D.13.4.1** Conversion Factors

Each fuel or energy used is converted using the factors:

a. Gasoline / Petrol                2.31 kg of CO2 per liter

b. E85                              1.65 kg of CO2 per liter

c. Electric                         0.65 kg of CO2 per kWh

**D.13.4.2** (EV only) Full credit is given for energy recovered through regenerative braking

**D.13.4.3** Scoring Term Definitions:

� CO2 min - the smallest mass of CO2 used by any competitor who is eligible for Efficiency
� CO2 your - the mass of CO2 used by the team being scored
� Tmin - the lowest Endurance time of the fastest team which is eligible for Efficiency

� Tyour - same as Endurance ([[#D.12.13 Endurance Scoring|D.12.13.1]])

� Lapyours - the number of laps driven by the team being scored

� Laptotal Tmin and Latptotal CO2 min - be the number of laps completed by the teams
which set Tmin and CO2min, respectively

**D.13.4.4** The Efficiency Factor is calculated by:

Efficiency Factor =                 Tmin / LapTotal Tmin      X  CO2 min / LapTotal CO2 min

Tyours / Lap yours           CO2 your / Lap yours

**D.13.4.5** EfficiencyFactor min is calculated using the above formula with:

� CO2 your                   (IC) equivalent to 60.06 kg CO2/100km (based on gasoline 26 ltr/100km)
� CO2 your                   (EV) equivalent to 20.02 kg CO2/100km
� Tyour                      1.45 times Tmin


**D.13.4.6** When the team is eligible for Efficiency. the team score is calculated as:

Efficiency Score =        100 x  Efficiency Factor your - Efficiency Factor min
Efficiency Factor max - Efficiency Factor min
